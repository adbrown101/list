#+TITLE: Using Forge

* Introduction
Although I am reasonably confident issuing and dealing with pull requests using the git-hub web interface, I do all of my other git work using Magit. I would like to use forge to manage my pull requests etc.
* Actions
- New Github account
- Create local repo
- push repo new account
- Fork to existing github account
- Create local copy with branches
- Push back to pushremote
- Create pull request
